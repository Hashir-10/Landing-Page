            <h1>One-piece is awesome</h1>
            <p>
              This is a one-piece themed landing page, created for fun and
              practice. It is not affiliated with the official One-piece
              franchise. The content is purely for entertainment purposes. I
              chose One-piece because I am a huge fan of it. Below is some fun
              stuff about the anime. I am just a beginner so dont expect this
              website to be good. I happily accept any feedback on how to
              improve, If you want to give one, Please email me at the
              email-address given in the contact section. If you want to see the
              source code, you can see that on my github whose link too is in
              the contact section. Yokosou, nakama! Ready for an adventure ?

            The vast world of One-piece is goverened by a huge organisation,
            "World-Government". They fight for justice across the seas and aim
            to bring peace into the world.... or do they? This organisation
            holds many dark secrets hidden from common eyes.

            The 4 unshakable titans also known as "Yonkos" who rule the seas
            with a might that even the World-Government thinks twice before
            engaging with them on any matter. There names are : "Red-hair
            Shanks", "Straw-hat Luffy", "Blackbeard(Marshall.D.Teach)". "Buggy
            the clown".

            In the vast world of One-piece there are many mysteries, one of
            which are ancient-weapons. They are known as super destructive
            weapons from 800 years ago which can even destroy islands in a
            blink. As of now there is still not much information about them but
            their names are: "Pluton", "Uranus", "Poseidon".

          <p>
            In One-piece there are mysterious fruits that when eaten give you
            powers of different kind but on the cost of your swimming ability.
            There are 4 types of devil fruit in One-piece: "Paramecia", "Logia",
            "Zoan", "God-fruits".

          <p>
            The One-piece world also has various creatures around the seas. Some
            can be extremely dangerous and life threatening while others are
            calm and friendly.

          <p>
            To navigate through this vast ocean of mysteries an item called
            "Log-pose" is used, mainly at the grand-line. Each log-pose work
            differently, there are three main types: "Standard log-pose",
            "Eternal log-pose", "New-world log-pose".

          <p>
            Raftel or more accurately "Laugh-tale" is the last island of
            grand-line at the end of new-world. This is the island for which
            pirates are so eager to sail the seas and the island which holds
            many secrets of the world. It requires four road-poneglyphs to reach
            there. By far only one pirate crew has reached it "Gol.D.Rogers
            pirate crew". It will be ground breaking to see who reaches it next.

          Some random One-Piece facts that might make zoro's sense of direction
          better
        </h2>
        <div class="fact">
          <h3>Luffy Eats Like a Black Hole</h3>
          <p>
            Luffy Eats Like a Black Hole Seriously, our Straw Hat captain can
            down more meat in one sitting than an entire pirate crew. Legend
            says he once ate so much that even Sanji had to blush—no joke, he
            left half the ship’s provisions gone and then asked for seconds.
            🍖🚀

          <h3>Usopp’s Lies Are Actually Helpful… Sometimes</h3>
          <p>
            You know Usopp’s tall tales and “I’m the greatest warrior” stuff?
            Believe it or not, some of his made-up stories have tricked enemies
            into running away—like that time he pretended to be a giant snake
            and everyone noped out. Turns out, fear is a killer weapon. 🐍 While
            we are talking about our brave warriour of the sea, legends say he
            is the soge king 😱.
          </p>

          <h3>Chopper’s Transformations Are Basically Mood Swings</h3>
          <p>
            Our cutest doctor has seven forms—and yes, he really does flip
            through them like TV channels whenever he’s moody, happy, or just
            hungry. One minute he’s a tiny reindeer; the next he’s a
            muscle-bound monster. Talk about a personality disorder… in the best
            way possible. 🦌💥
          </p>

        <div class="fact">
          <h3>Franky’s “Super” Obsession with Cola</h3>
          <p>
            This cyborg runs on cola like a car on gasoline. He’s literally
            built with a Coke tank in his chest—no cola, no power. Miss your
            morning coffee? Franky’d collapse mid-“SUPER!” pose. 🥤🤖 Wonder
            what will happen if he eats some mentos?
          </p>

        <div class="fact">
          <h3>Zoro’s Terrible Sense of Direction… On Purpose?</h3>
          <p>
            Roronoa Zoro is famous for getting lost literally everywhere—even in
            straight hallways. Oda-sensei once said that Zoro’s navigational
            disasters are “part of his fighting style,” since getting lost has
            become his signature quirk (and a great comedic beat). 🧭❌ And
            these absurd facts might not make his sense of direction better 😅.
