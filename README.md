# Landing-Page (Practice-project)

This is a basic landing-page designed with simple html and css. The original design of the project belongs to "The Odin Project". I added a bit of my own taste to the original design. I made it One-piece themed while maintaining the original design. I thought it will make it look a bit fun lol. The site is not responsive yet as I dont know responsive designing as of now. I will make sure to come back to this practice-project and make it responsive.
