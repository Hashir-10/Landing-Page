            <h1>One-piece is awesome</h1>
            <p>
              This is a one-piece themed landing page, created for fun and
              practice. It is not affiliated with the official One-piece
              franchise. The content is purely for entertainment purposes. I chose One-piece because I am a huge fan of it. Below is some fun stuff about the anime. I am just a beginner so dont expect this website to be good. I happily accept any feedback on how to improve, If you want to give one, Please email me at the email-address given in the contact section. If you want to see the source code, you can see that on my github whose link too is in the contact section. Yokosou, nakama! Ready for an adventure ?
